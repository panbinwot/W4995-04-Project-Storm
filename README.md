# W4995-04-Project-Storm
## Introduction
The project is a python implementation of Stochastic Recursive Momentum (Storm). We compare the performance of Storm with Adam and Adagrad. The method is implemented in storm.py

### About the Method
DDLs hunt me down..

## Data
We use CIFAR-10 as the dataset. It contains 60,000 32x32 images.
See [here](https://github.com/EN10/CIFAR) and [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) for python usage. More infor about CIFAR can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Environment
python3.7, pytorch,.....
```python

```

## Network
To test the network, we use the ResNet18 and ResNet32 as introduced [here](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/)

## Usage
```python
python3 main.py
```

## Result
Nothing juicy....
